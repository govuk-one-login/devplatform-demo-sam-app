# node-fargate-app

This project contains source code and supporting files for a fargate application that you can deploy with the SAM CLI. It includes the following files and folders.

- server.js - Code for the application.
- template.yaml - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.

The application uses several AWS resources, including an API Gateway API. These resources are defined in the `template.yaml` file in this project.
You can update the template to add AWS resources through the same deployment process that updates your application code.
