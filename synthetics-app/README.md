# Synthetics canary app

This template contains a very simple AWS::Synthetics::Canary resource.
The main purpose of this app is to test the deployment and promotion of synthetic canary artifacts via secure pipelines.
At the moment, the script used by this template does not perform any significant tests. This could be developed into a more useful tool in the future.
